  <b>Helping families locate summer meal sites faster than ever before at <a href="https://meals4kidsok.org">Meals4KidsOk.org</a></b>
</h3>

In partnership with [Hunger Free Oklahoma](https://hungerfreeok.org/), Code for Tulsa has assembled this responsive web app allowing families to find summer meal sites quickly and efficiently, either at home or on the go!

The [Summer Food Service Program](https://www.fns.usda.gov/sfsp/summer-food-service-program) is a federally-funded, state-administered program ensuring Children have Access to Nutritious Meals and Snacks When School is not in Session.

## Getting started
__If you'd like to run a local version of the app, follow these instructions below:__
> __Please note before cloning:__  You'll need special access to the firebase project to get things working properly‚Äîeven locally.  Please reach out if you're looking to contribute to this project or investigate further.


* Clone the repo, and in the root directory run `yarn install` to download all project depencies. (_You may need to get [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) if you haven't already..._)
* Run `yarn start` to spin up a locally running version of the site.
* Make sure you have either placed the _`.env`_ file from Code for Tulsa's 1Pass account into your root directory, OR edit the environment variables in _`App.tsx`_ to link to appropriate API keys and resources.

> Your _`.env`_ file should look a little something like:
>```
>REACT_APP_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
>REACT_APP_GOOGLE_SHEET_NAME_DEV=Locations_dev
>REACT_APP_GOOGLE_SHEET_NAME=Locations
>
>REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
>REACT_APP_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_CODE=UA-xxxxxxxxx-x
